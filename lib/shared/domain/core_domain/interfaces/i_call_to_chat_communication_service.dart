/// ðŸŽ¯ **Call to Chat Communication Interface** - Bounded Context Abstraction
///
/// Defines the contract for communication between the call bounded context
/// and the chat bounded context. This interface enables loose coupling and
/// maintains bounded context isolation.
///
/// **Purpose:**
/// - Abstract chat operations needed by call context
/// - Enable dependency inversion between bounded contexts
/// - Maintain clean architecture principles
///
/// **DDD Principles:**
/// - âœ… Interface Segregation (only chat operations needed by calls)
/// - âœ… Dependency Inversion (call context depends on abstraction)
/// - âœ… Bounded Context Isolation (no direct coupling)

  /// [model] Optional AI model to use
  /// Returns Future that completes when message is sent

  /// Send a call-related message with additional metadata
  ///
  /// [text] The message text
  /// [callId] Optional call identifier for tracking
  /// [callType] Type of call (incoming, outgoing, etc.)
