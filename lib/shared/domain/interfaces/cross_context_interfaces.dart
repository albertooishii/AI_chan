// Shared Domain Interfaces for Cross-Context Communication
//
// This file contains interfaces that allow bounded contexts to communicate
// without creating direct dependencies between them.
//
// Note: TTS/STT interfaces were moved to use centralized services directly
// Note: Call context interfaces were removed as call context doesn't exist

// Currently empty - cross-context interfaces have been consolidated
// Use centralized services directly instead of duplicated interfaces
