// 🏗️ Cross-Context Service Adapters
//
// This file previously contained adapters for cross-context interfaces.
// These have been eliminated in favor of using centralized services directly.
//
// Note: TTS/STT adapters removed - use CentralizedTtsService/CentralizedSttService directly
// Note: Call context adapters removed - call context doesn't exist

// File intentionally left empty after Phase 3.4 consolidation
